# ribbot-trivia

This is a fork of just the [trivia folder]((https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop/redbot/cogs/trivia/data/lists/)) of [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot), a fully modular bot for Discord. This repo is used to manage the trivia for the Nookipedia's own instance of Red, which we call Ribbot. Having our own repository allows members to more easily contribute and see their changes live quickly. It also allows us to include categories that may not be appropriate for upstream (e.g. questions about Nookipedia or Nookipedia meta).

Contributors to this repo are encouraged to also submit their fixes and additions to [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) as appropriate.
